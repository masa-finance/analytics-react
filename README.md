### Extending to Include Additional Event Data

You can extend the tracking function to collect additional event data using the `additionalEventData` field as shown in this example. In this example we want to track and log the transaction hash and the protocol fee for making the swap so we can track swap revenue in Masa Analytics. `additionalEventData` can take any information you want to add for future reference or running custom analytics with Masa. 

```typescript
import { useMasaAnalyticsReact } from "@masa-finance/analytics-react";

const { fireEvent } = useMasaAnalyticsReact({
  clientApp: "My App",
  clientName: "My Company Name",
  clientId: '1234-5678-9012-4567'
});

// Track a swap event with additional data
const user_address = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e";
const network = "goerli";
const contract_address = "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e";
const asset_amount = "1.20";
const asset_ticker = "ETH";

void fireEvent( "swap" , {
  user_address: user_address,
  network: network,
  contract_address: contract_address,
  asset_amount: asset_amount,
  asset_ticker: asset_ticker,
  additionalEventData: {
    transactionHash: "0x83138032f1e7bee64fccd15bbed403f6b875c47641f6b203cd59dfa9b7cf1b4a",
    fee: "0.12",
    fee_asset: "ETH"
  }
});
```


These events can be used to monitor user interactions with your website and app, helping you make data-driven decisions and improve the user experience.
