## Events Tracking and Usage

This package provides built-in support for tracking two types of events: Ethereum message signing and page visits. These events can be easily integrated into your application to gather insights about user interactions.

### Ethereum Message Signing Event

`signMessageAndTrack` function is provided to sign Ethereum messages and track the event. It takes the following parameters:

- `provider`: An instance of `ethers.Provider` or any compatible provider.
- `signer`: An instance of `ethers.Signer` representing the user's Ethereum wallet.
- `message`: The message to be signed.
- `apiUrl`: The API URL where the event data will be sent.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { signMessageAndTrack } from 'zksbt-cookie';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Set up the provider and signer
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY');
const signer = provider.getSigner();

// Sign a message and track the event
const message = 'Hello, World!';
const apiUrl = 'https://your-api.example.com/events';
signMessageAndTrack(provider, signer, message, apiUrl);
```

### Page Visit Event

`trackPageVisit` function is provided to send a page visit event to your API. It takes the following parameters:

- `accountId`: A unique identifier for the user, such as a user ID or Ethereum address.
- `apiUrl`: The API URL where the event data will be sent.
- `pageName` (optional): A custom name for the page being visited.
- `additionalData` (optional): Additional data to be included in the event payload.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { trackPageVisit } from 'zksbt-cookie';

// Track a page visit event
const accountId = '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e';
const apiUrl = 'https://your-api.example.com/events';
const pageName = 'Homepage';
const additionalData = { referrer: document.referrer };

trackPageVisit(accountId, apiUrl, pageName, additionalData);
```

These events can be used to monitor user interactions with your website, helping you make data-driven decisions and improve the user experience.
